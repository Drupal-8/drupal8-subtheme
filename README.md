# drupal8-subtheme
Drupal 8 subtheme based on Gratis theme. Uses SASS, Grunt, Bourbon and lots of cool stuff.

## Setup

1. Copy `themes` folder to Drupal 8 root.
2. Change `THEMENAME` strings to your own project's name.
3. Install Gratis and your subtheme in `Admin > Appearance`.

## Build

1. `cd` into your theme.
2. Run `npm install` (needs http://nodejs.org/).
3. Run `grunt` in your theme directory. This runs grunt-sass and grunt-watch.
